# OOT2D-original-source
stub for actual release im working to get out, most likely uncompileble and pirate software quality

the c language source isnt uploaded yet however its going to be dogshit.
oot 2d ahd 2 developers, the first version was an attempt to port oot to game maker.

this second version was an attempt to continue it after the creator died. it used c code pngs for sprites etc.
the source is not lostn and is 4 states away currently.

# why do i have to do it?
my old username was originaLink and i helped with graphics related tasks.

# why do i need to get the source code yet?
Flotonic was not very trusting of people around that time in 2012, ive made suggestions and had a bigger involvement with ideas
and design. sprite work i did directly.

# whats in the repo for now?
builds we still have.

# what can be done now?
for the game maker version.
no one has tried to compile the game maker file.
for the flotonic areoblast version:
the engine doesnt hard lock sprites as i used builds for quick testing when doing art. it also might run.

# are they safe?
it isnt malware but if you care about memory safety you probably can guess considering the age range of the programmers.
