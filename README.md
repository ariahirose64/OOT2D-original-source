# OOT2D-original-source
stub for actual release im working to get out, most likely uncompileble and pirate software quality

the source isnt uplaoaded yet however its going to be dogshit.
oot 2d was an attempt to port oot to game maker, this is NOT that version.

this version was an attempt to continue it after the creator died. it used c code pngs for sprites etc.

#why do i have to do it?
my old username was originaLink and i helped with graphics related tasks.

#why do i need to get the source code yet?
Flotonic was not very trusting of people around that time in 2012, ive made suggestions and had a bigger involvement with ideas
and design. sprite work i did directly.

#whats in the repo for now?
builds we still have.

#what can be done now?
the engine doesnt hard lock sprites as i used builds for quick testing when doing art. it aslo might run.

#are they safe?
it isnt malware but if you care about memory safety you probably can guess considering the age range of the programmers.
